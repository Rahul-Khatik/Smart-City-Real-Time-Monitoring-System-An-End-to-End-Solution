### Technologies Used

- AWS (S3, Glue, Redshift, Lambda)
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Spark
- Docker
- PowerBI

### Installation

```bash
pip install gpxpy
```
### Usage

This project utilizes Docker for environment management. Start by logging into Docker Hub to pull the necessary Kafka images. 
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To begin streaming data:
Start Kafka to send data to topics.

```bash
python jobs/main.py
```
Execute Spark to consume topics and push data to S3.

```bash
     ##Windows PowerShell##
docker exec -it smartcityrvm-spark-master-1 spark-submit `
--master spark://spark-master:7077 `
--packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.5.0,org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.1,com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk:1.11.469 `
jobs/spark-city.py
```
